# Registration_Form_
In this project, I have created user-friendly registration form using
HTML and CSS. This hands-on exercise aims to solidify  understanding of web development
concepts and equip  with the skills needed to build a functional and visually appealing user
registration experience.
Applied CSS for creating a form that not only works  flawlessly but looks fantastic too. Considered using flexbox or grid for a modern layout design.
Responsive Design: Ensure the form adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, making it user-
friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
